# Programming

I work on a Linux PC. My text editor of choice is [vim](https://www.vim.org/).

Professionally my focus has been on full-stack web development and Linux system administration. 

I am currently working as a [freelance & contract web developer]({% link _programming/web.md %}) while studying [music]({% link _music/index.md %}) and creative programming. 

If you are interested you can check out my [web development project portfolio]({% link _programming/web/projects.md %}) or read more about my [background in computers and programming]({% link _programming/background.md %}).
