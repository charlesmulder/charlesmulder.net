# Programming

I work on Linux. My editor of choice is vim. 

Professionally my focus has been on web development and system administration. 

I am currently doing [freelance web development]({% link _programming/web.md %}) whilst studying [music]({% link _music/index.md %}) and audio programming. 

If you are interested you can read more about my [background in computers and programming]({% link _programming/background.md %}).
