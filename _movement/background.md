# Movement background

Being a shy and introverted child I never really liked team sports. I preferred judo, karate or swimming.

I was never very committed to sports during school or university. 

I only realised the importance of movement years later.

I was spending most of my waking hours in front of a PC. My shoulders were in constant spasm and my overall health was deteriorating. 

Things began to change when I started training in ninjitsu.

A few years later I discovered Bujinkan, Jiva Mukti yoga and Acro Yoga. 

In 2014 I trained Bujinkan at the Honbu Dojo in Noda-shi, Japan and also attended Divine Play and Acrogasm workshops in Portland, United States. 

I am currently practicing Iyengar yoga and Aikido in the Cape Winelands city of Paarl.
