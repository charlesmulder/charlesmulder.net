# Music

I compose, record and perform music on a guitar and Linux PC.

At the moment I am formally studying music theory and classical guitar through Hugo Lambrechts Music Centre as well as music technology through Stellenbosch University. 

I hope to start work on new musical projects upon completion of this phase of my studies.
